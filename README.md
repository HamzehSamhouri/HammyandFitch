## General Information
Hammy & Fitch is a recreation of [Abercrombie and Fitch's](https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us) eCommerce website, emulating both the shoppers' and managers' experience/functionality. 

Through recreating a smooth front-end user experience with challenging CSS design, as well as back-end databases, I chose to recreate a website from an established brand to challenge myself as a full-stack software developer.
